sbt-web-project-with-angular
============================

A hacking project using the sbt web plugin and the base new scala 2.3 features to work on getting Angular set up.

This doesn't currently work as it can't resolve the angular mocks library. I've disabled rjs and require, coffeescript, jshint, etc, so I can try to troubleshoot the angularjs mocha test.

Once it does I'll update this readme.
